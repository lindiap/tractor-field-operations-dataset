Using: (i) the generated anomaly cases, (ii) the descriptions of each case, (iii) the activities performed, and (iv) the operational ranges of the relevant variables, create a set of rules for each anomaly case that defines how each involved variable changes numerically. Additionally, indicate the total duration of the anomaly for each case. Note that the session during which anomalies are applied lasts approximately {{session_duration}}, with measurements recorded at a frequency of {{observations_frequency}}.
Please format your output as follows:
	- <case_name> (<activity_performed>):
		- <duration>
		- rules:
			- <var_name>: <rule_description>
			- . . .
	- . . .
