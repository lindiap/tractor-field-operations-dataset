As an experienced Python developer, we request your support in scripting code.
You are provided with a set of rules for various anomaly cases that describe how
each involved variable changes numerically, along with the total duration of the
anomaly. The anomaly cases are formatted as follows:
	- <case_name> (<activity_performed>):
		- <duration>
		- rules:
			- <var_name>: <rule_description>
			- . . .
Using this information, create a Python function that applies a specified anomaly
case to a time series of sensor data. The code should meet the following require-
ments:
	- handle all provided anomaly cases;
	- use random values instead of fixed anomalous values;
	- read the input dataframe from a provided CSV;
	- accept the start time and the anomaly to apply as inputs;
	- provide only the function without any example usage.
