As an experienced specialist in {{agricultural_machinery_type}}, we request your expertise in analyzing various operational parameters collected from the machineryâ€™s CAN bus. 
You are provided with a list of variables, each including its name, operational bounds, unit of measurement, and description. 
The variables are formatted as follows:
	- <var_name> (<operational_range> <unit>): <var_description>
	- . . .
Your task is to generate significant anomaly cases based on the activities performed by the machinery, i.e., {{list_of_activities}}. 
Each anomaly case should include:
	- a description of the anomaly
	- the list of variables involved
	- the activity being performed when the anomaly occurs
Please format your output as follows:
	- <case_name>: <case_description>
		- variables involved:
			- <var_name>
			- . . .
		- <activity_performed>
	- . . .
Input variables: {{input}}
